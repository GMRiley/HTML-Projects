	           <p>My name is <b>Kyle Riley</b>. I come from a town called <i>Belchertown</i>, it's in Massachussetts. This town is fairy close to Amherst, so I usually say I'm from Amherst. During my k-12 education, I have discovered two passions that I have. These passions are music and programming. Each one being a different form of passion, but still passions nonetheless. <br> I found music and began to play at the age of seven. I started with a drumset and a hand me down pair of sticks. I did have a classical guitar at this age, but I didn't have availability to guitar lessons. But the drum ones were free. I continued to play music from that age, all through High school. I played in Jazz, rock, and metal groups and the school band until graduation. When coming here, I have seen a lot less opportunity for music and I miss it.<br>When I got to high school, I started to become interested in programming. So in my Freshman year, I decided to use online courses and learn C++. I was able to practice this language for two years until I was able to take Comp. Sci my Junio year. Here I was taught Java and utilizing data and memory locations. Once I got to my Senior year, my Computer Science teacher would face getting fired <strong>(for posting racist slurs on Facebook)</strong> and would leave the students in Comp Sci 1 and 2. So I took over and taught the course in his place, using the notes he left behind. </p>
